### Week 1 & 2 Work Summary (Track A + Track B)

During the first two weeks, we successfully completed the foundational requirements of Track A and Track B, along with some additional enhancements.

Key work completed:
- Created the GitHub repository with a clean and modular project structure
- Set up the backend using Node.js and Python
- Implemented APIs to handle file uploads (payment screenshots and documents)
- Integrated OCR functionality to extract text from payment screenshots
- Processed and cleaned extracted text for reliable data handling
- Built basic expense extraction logic (amount, date, merchant)
- Implemented rule-based expense categorization (Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.)
- Integrated AI-based financial advice generation using established financial principles
- Connected Node.js backend with Python services for OCR and AI processing
- Ensured backend is extensible for future integrations (CSV, bank statements, APIs)

Outcome:
A working backend-driven prototype that:
- Accepts payment screenshots as input
- Extracts and structures expense data using OCR
- Categorizes expenses accurately
- Generates basic financial advice using AI
- Is designed with scalability for advanced financial features
